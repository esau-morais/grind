Switch themes at runtime via `/theme` in the chat screen, or set the default in your config.

## Built-in Themes

| Theme         | Description                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `grind`       | Default dark orange theme matching the Grind brand |
| `tokyo-night` | Deep blue-purple Tokyo Night palette               |
| `catppuccin`  | Catppuccin Mocha: muted pastels on dark background |
| `dracula`     | Classic Dracula purple and pink                    |

## Switching Themes

In the TUI chat screen:

```
/theme
```

Select from the list. The theme applies immediately across all screens.

## Custom Themes

Theme files are JSON loaded from `~/.grind/themes/`. To create a custom theme:

1. Copy an existing theme file as a reference
2. Save it to `~/.grind/themes/my-theme.json`
3. Select it via `/theme` in the TUI
