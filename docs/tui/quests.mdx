Press `q` to open the quests screen.

Displays all quests across all statuses with:

- Quest title and type badge
- Difficulty indicator
- Current status (`available`, `active`, `completed`, `failed`, `abandoned`)
- Streak count for `daily` and `weekly` quests
- Last completed timestamp

Quests are grouped by status: active first, then available, then completed.
