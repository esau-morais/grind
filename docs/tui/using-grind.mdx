The TUI is a full-screen terminal app that gives you a live view of your quests, stats, and skill progress. It runs at 30fps and stays open while you work.

## Keyboard Navigation

| Key      | Screen              |

| `d`      | Dashboard           |
| `q`      | Quests              |
| `s`      | Skills              |
| `c`      | Chat (AI companion) |

| `Ctrl-C` | Quit                |

## Dashboard

The default screen when you open the TUI.

**Left: Active Quests**

All quests you've started. Each shows type, difficulty, streak count, and a running timer if one is active.

**Right: Stats**

Your character level, XP bar to next level, quests completed today, best active streak, and top skills.

**Bottom: Completed Today**

Everything you've logged today, with XP earned and the proof type that was recorded.

## Quests

Press `q` to see all your quests across every status (active, available, completed, failed, and abandoned). Quests are sorted by status, with active ones first.

Each row shows the quest title, type badge, difficulty, current status, and streak count for habits.

## Skills

Press `s` to see your full skill tree. Every skill shows:

- Current level
- XP progress bar toward the next level
- Total XP accumulated

Skills are displayed with their hierarchy intact: parent skills at the top, children indented beneath.
