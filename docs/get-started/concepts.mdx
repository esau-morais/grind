## Quests

Every goal in Grind is a quest. Quests move through a simple lifecycle:

| State       | Meaning                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `available` | Ready to be started                |
| `active`    | In progress                        |
| `completed` | Done, XP awarded                   |
| `failed`    | Deadline passed without completion |
| `abandoned` | Manually dropped                   |

### Types

| Type     | Resets         | Best for                  |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| `daily`  | Every midnight | Daily habits              |
| `weekly` | Every Monday   | Weekly goals              |
| `bounty` | Never          | One-off tasks             |
| `epic`   | Never          | Multi-step projects       |
| `chain`  | Never          | Sequential workflows      |
| `ritual` | On a schedule  | Recurring structured work |

### Difficulty

| Difficulty | XP multiplier |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `easy`     | 1.0x          |
| `medium`   | 1.5x          |
| `hard`     | 2.0x          |
| `epic`     | 3.0x          |

## XP

XP is deterministic. The same inputs always produce the same output:

```
final_xp = base_xp × difficulty × streak_bonus × proof_bonus
```

Your character levels up as XP accumulates. Early levels come quickly; later ones require more. Each skill also has its own independent level curve, so skills you use often will advance faster.

## Skill Trees

Skills are hierarchical. When you complete a quest, XP flows to every skill tagged on that quest. Each skill tracks its own XP; parent skills do not automatically inherit from children.

You can build any tree structure that makes sense for your life. Common starting trees:

- **Body** → Fitness → Strength / Cardio / Mobility
- **Mind** → Focus / Learning → Reading / Courses
- **Work** → Engineering / Writing

## Streaks

Streaks are per-quest. A daily quest tracks consecutive days completed; a weekly quest tracks consecutive weeks.

| Days  | Tier         | XP bonus |
| ----- | ------------ | -------- |
| 1–2   | —            | 0%       |
| 3–6   | Spark        | +10%     |
| 7–13  | Flame        | +20%     |
| 14–29 | Blaze        | +30%     |
| 30–59 | Inferno      | +40%     |
| 60–99 | Wildfire     | +45%     |
| 100+  | Eternal Fire | +50%     |

**Streak shields** protect against a single missed day. They're earned through consistent long streaks and consumed automatically before the streak breaks.

## Proof

Proof is evidence of completion. The type of proof you submit determines a multiplier on your XP:

| Type             | Multiplier | How it's created                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `self-report`    | 1.0x       | Clicking complete with no other signal     |
| `timestamp`      | 1.1x       | Logged at a specific time                  |
| `duration`       | 1.1x       | Logged with elapsed time from a timer      |
| `process-check`  | 1.2x       | A matching process was detected running    |
| `file-change`    | 1.2x       | A file was modified in a tracked directory |
| `git-commit`     | 1.3x       | A commit was made to a tracked repo        |
| `screenshot`     | 1.3x       | Image attached as evidence                 |
| `ai-verify`      | 1.4x       | Companion confirmed the activity           |
| `calendar-match` | 1.3x       | A calendar event matched                   |
| `multi-proof`    | 1.5x       | Multiple proof types combined              |

The Forge can automatically generate `multi-proof` by combining git activity, process detection, and duration, giving you the maximum multiplier with no extra effort.

## Companion Trust

The AI companion has five trust levels. Higher trust means more autonomy:

| Level | Name      | Capabilities                                       |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Watcher   | Read-only: observe quests and stats                |
| 1     | Advisor   | Suggest quests, warn about missed goals            |
| 2     | Scribe    | Create quests, log entries, read-only tools        |
| 3     | Agent     | Execute tools, modify quests, bash (with approval) |
| 4     | Sovereign | Full autonomy, no approval prompts                 |

See [Your AI Companion](/companion/overview) to configure trust level and set up a provider.

## The Forge

The Forge is a background automation engine. It watches for signals and fires actions when rules match.

**Signal sources:**

- Git commits in watched repositories
- File changes in watched directories
- Running processes that match a pattern
- Webhooks from Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or Google Calendar

**Actions a rule can trigger:**

- Create or complete a quest
- Award XP directly
- Send a notification
- Run a script

Rules run on a schedule (cron) or react immediately when a signal arrives. See [Forge](/cli/forge) for how to create and manage rules.
