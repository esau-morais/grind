The gateway is a Bun HTTP server (`Bun.serve`) defined in `packages/core/src/gateway/server.ts`. It normalizes incoming webhooks from five sources into a unified `Signal` format stored in the `signals` table for the Forge to process.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path                     | Integration                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/health`                | Health check, returns `{ status: 'ok' }`                         |
| `POST` | `/hooks/inbound`         | Generic inbound signal (HMAC-verified via `GRIND_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) |
| `POST` | `/hooks/telegram`        | Telegram Bot API updates                                         |
| `POST` | `/hooks/discord`         | Discord interactions (Ed25519 signature verification)            |
| `POST` | `/hooks/google-calendar` | Google Calendar push notifications                               |
| `POST` | `/hooks/whatsapp`        | WhatsApp Cloud API (HMAC-SHA256 signature verification)          |

WhatsApp also handles `GET /hooks/whatsapp` for the webhook verification challenge.

## Signature Verification

### Discord

Discord uses Ed25519 signatures verified with the Web Crypto API:

```typescript
const isValid = await crypto.subtle.verify("Ed25519", publicKey, signature, body);
```

Key is read from `GRIND_DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`. Requests failing verification return 401.

### WhatsApp Cloud API

WhatsApp signs payloads with HMAC-SHA256 using the app secret:

```typescript
const expectedSig = `sha256=${hmacSha256(GRIND_WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET, rawBody)}`;
const isValid = timingSafeEqual(expectedSig, xHubSignature);
```

### Telegram

Telegram does not sign individual payloads. The bot token in the webhook URL path acts as the secret.

## Signal Normalization

`gateway/normalize.ts` converts each platform's payload into a unified `Signal`:

```typescript
type Signal = {
  id: string;
  source: "telegram" | "discord" | "whatsapp" | "google-calendar" | "inbound";
  type: string;
  payload: unknown;
  normalizedText?: string;
  senderId?: string;
  channelId?: string;
  timestamp: number;
};
```

Signals are stored to the `signals` table and consumed by the Forge daemon on its next tick.

## Configuration

| Variable                              | Description                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `GRIND_GATEWAY_PORT`                  | Port to listen on (default: `5174`)  |
| `GRIND_GATEWAY_TOKEN`                 | HMAC secret for `/hooks/inbound`     |
| `GRIND_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`            | Telegram bot token                   |
| `GRIND_DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`            | Discord app public key for Ed25519   |
| `GRIND_WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET`           | WhatsApp app secret for HMAC         |
| `GRIND_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CHANNEL_TOKEN` | Token for calendar push verification |

See [Environment Reference](/reference/env) for the complete list including webhook paths and host binding.

## Adding a New Webhook Source

1. Add a new endpoint case in `gateway/server.ts`
2. Implement signature verification if required
3. Add a normalizer in `gateway/normalize.ts`
4. Handle the new signal type in `forge/engine.ts`
