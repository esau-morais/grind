The streak module lives in `packages/core/src/streak.ts`.

## Per-Quest Streaks

Streaks are tracked independently per quest, not globally. Each `daily` quest has its own counter. Each `weekly` quest has its own counter.

The counter lives on the quest record: `streakCurrent` and `streakBest`.

## Tiers

| Consecutive Days | Tier Name    | XP Bonus |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 0–2              | —            | +0%      |
| 3–6              | Spark        | +10%     |
| 7–13             | Flame        | +20%     |
| 14–29            | Blaze        | +30%     |
| 30–59            | Inferno      | +40%     |
| 60–99            | Wildfire     | +45%     |
| 100+             | Eternal Fire | +50%     |

`streakTier(days)` returns the tier name and XP multiplier for any day count.

## Breaking a Streak

A streak breaks when a daily quest is not completed before midnight (in the user's configured timezone). The scheduler calls `resetQuestStreak` when this happens:

1. `streakCurrent` resets to 0
2. A "broken streak" penalty note is logged
3. Any shield is consumed before breaking (see below)

## Streak Shields

Shields protect against a single missed day. When a streak would break, Grind first checks for an available shield. If one exists, it is consumed and the streak is preserved.

Shields are earned by maintaining long streaks. The threshold and maximum shield count are defined in `streak.ts`.

## API

```typescript
import { streakTier, streakMultiplier, hasStreakShield } from "@grindxp/core";

const tier = streakTier(21); // → { name: 'Blaze', days: 21 }
const mult = streakMultiplier(21); // → 1.30
const shielded = hasStreakShield(quest); // → boolean
```
