## The `~/.grind/` Directory

All Grind data and configuration lives in `~/.grind/` by default (overridable via `GRIND_VAULT_PATH`).

```
~/.grind/
├── vault.db          # Encrypted SQLite database
├── config.json       # Settings + AES encryption key (keep this safe — losing it makes vault.db unrecoverable)
├── timer.json        # Active timer state
├── gateway.pid       # Gateway process PID (when running)
└── themes/           # Custom theme files
```

## Config File

`~/.grind/config.json` is created by `grindxp init`:

```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "companion": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    "name": "Max",
    "trustLevel": 1
  }
}
```

The file also stores `encryptionKey` (the AES key for `vault.db`), `vaultPath`, and integration credentials. Do not commit it to source control.

Most settings are managed via CLI commands (`grindxp setup`, `grindxp companion soul`) rather than editing the file directly.

## Companion Settings

Companion configuration is stored in two places:

- **`~/.grind/config`**: provider, model, and name (read on startup)
- **`companion_settings` table**: full settings including personality, trust level, and focus areas (read from vault)

The vault record takes precedence. CLI commands write to both.

## Migrating to a New Machine

1. Copy `~/.grind/vault.db` to the new machine
2. Copy `~/.grind/config.json` to the same path (contains encryption key — required for decryption)
3. Install Grind and run `grindxp status` to verify

Alternatively, enable Turso sync and pull the vault from the cloud on the new machine.

## Vault Path Override

To use a non-default vault location, set `GRIND_VAULT_PATH` before running any command:

```bash
GRIND_VAULT_PATH=/data/grind/vault.db grindxp status
```

This is useful for running multiple separate vaults (e.g., personal vs. work).
