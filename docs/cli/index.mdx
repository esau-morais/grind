```bash
grindxp <command> [subcommand]
```

All commands open the vault at `~/.grind/vault.db` on startup. Run `grindxp init` first if the vault doesn't exist yet.

---

## Quick Commands

### `status`

```bash
grindxp status
```

Snapshot of your current state: character level, XP bar, active quests, best streak, and top skills.

### `dashboard`

```bash
grindxp dashboard
```

Time-aware overview. Output adapts to time of day: morning shows today's quests and streak status, evening shows what you completed and XP earned.

For a persistent real-time view, use `grindxp` (the TUI) instead.

### `log`

```bash
grindxp log
```

Record a quick activity without creating a full quest. Prompts for description, optional skill tags, and optional duration. XP flows to tagged skills. Use this for one-offs; create a proper quest for recurring behaviors to get streak bonuses.
