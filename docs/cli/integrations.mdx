## WhatsApp Web

WhatsApp Web uses the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library to connect via the WhatsApp Web protocol (no cloud API key needed):

```bash
grindxp integrations
# Select: WhatsApp Web
# Choose: QR Code or Pairing Code
```

A QR code is displayed in the terminal. Scan it with WhatsApp on your phone to link.

<Warning>
  WhatsApp Web sessions can be revoked by WhatsApp at any time. Use the official WhatsApp Cloud API
  for more stable integrations.
