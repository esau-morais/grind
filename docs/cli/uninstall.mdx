```bash

```

Without flags, an interactive multiselect lets you choose which components to remove. Pass explicit flags to skip the prompt.

## Flags

| Flag           | Description                                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--all`        | Select all scopes (gateway, web, vault)                                                  |
| `--gateway`    | Stop the gateway process and remove its autostart service (launchd / systemd / schtasks) |
| `--web`        | Stop the background web app process                                                      |
| `--vault`      | Delete `~/.grind/` (removes the vault DB, config, encryption key, and all data)          |
| `--yes` / `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt                                                             |
| `--dry-run`    | Print what would be removed without making any changes                                   |

## What Gets Removed

| Scope     | What is removed                                                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gateway` | Running gateway process (SIGTERM → SIGKILL) + autostart service registration                 |
| `web`     | Running web app process (SIGTERM → SIGKILL)                                                  |
| `vault`   | `~/.grind/`: vault DB, config, encryption key, timer state, auth tokens, service state files |

The CLI binary itself is **not** removed. After uninstalling, remove it manually:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash installer
  rm -rf ~/.grind/bin/
  ```

```bash bun
bun remove -g grindxp
```

```bash npm
npm uninstall -g grindxp
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm remove -g grindxp
```

```bash source
# Remove alias from ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
nano ~/.zshrc
# Delete the line: alias grindxp="bun --cwd ~/grind cli"

# Then delete the repo
rm -rf ~/grind
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  `--vault` deletes your vault, encryption key, and all quest data permanently. Back up
  `~/.grind/vault.db` and `~/.grind/config.json` before running if you want to preserve your data.
</Warning>
