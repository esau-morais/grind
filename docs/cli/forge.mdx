The Forge watches signals (git, filesystem, processes, webhooks) and applies rules to automatically manage quests and send notifications.

You can also manage forge rules via the Companion chat using `create_forge_rule`, `list_forge_rules`, `update_forge_rule`, `run_forge_rule`, and `delete_forge_rule`.

## Subcommands

### `forge create`

```bash
grindxp forge create
```

Interactive wizard to create a new forge rule. Prompts for:

- **Trigger type**: `cron`, `signal`, `webhook`, `event`, `manual`
- **Trigger config**: cron expression, signal source, watched path, process pattern, etc.
- **Action type**: `queue-quest`, `log-to-vault`, `send-notification`
- **Action config**: questId, activity type, notification channel, etc.

### `forge list`

```bash
grindxp forge list
```

Lists all forge rules with their trigger, action, enabled status, and last run time.

### `forge toggle`

```bash
grindxp forge toggle
```

Select a rule to enable or disable. Disabled rules are skipped during forge ticks.

### `forge run`

```bash
grindxp forge run
```

Manually trigger a single forge tick. Evaluates all enabled rules against current signals.

### `forge run-rule`

```bash
grindxp forge run-rule <ruleId>
```

Run a specific forge rule immediately, regardless of its trigger type. Useful for testing without waiting for the next tick.

### `forge tick`

```bash
grindxp forge tick
```

Same as `forge run` but outputs verbose debug output. Useful for debugging why a rule isn't firing.

### `forge daemon`

```bash
grindxp forge daemon
```

Starts the forge daemon as a foreground process. The daemon runs a tick on the configured interval (default 60s) and listens for real-time signals.

For production use, manage the daemon via the [`gateway`](/cli/gateway) command which handles process lifecycle.

| `signal`  | Fires when a signal is detected: git commit, file change, or running process (`triggerConfig.source = git\|file\|process`) |
| `webhook` | Fires when the gateway receives a matching inbound event                                                                   |

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue-quest`       | Re-activates a quest by ID (`actionConfig.questId`)                                                                  |
| `log-to-vault`      | Creates and auto-completes a bounty quest, awarding XP (`actionConfig.activityType`, `actionConfig.durationMinutes`) |
| `send-notification` | Sends a message via `console`, `telegram`, `webhook`, or `whatsapp` (`actionConfig.channel`, `actionConfig.message`) |

## Configuration Examples
