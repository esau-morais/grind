title: "grindxp stop"
description: "Stop the running timer and optionally complete the quest."
summary: "The stop command ends the active timer session. It prompts whether to mark the quest complete and records a duration-based proof."
read_when:
  - "User wants to stop a running timer"
  - "User finished working on a timed quest"

```bash
grindxp stop
```

Reads the active timer from `~/.grind/timer.json`, calculates elapsed time, and prompts:

1. **Complete the quest?** Yes logs a `duration` proof and awards XP. No just clears the timer.
2. If completing, optionally adds a note to the completion log.

## XP Awarded

The elapsed duration is recorded as a `duration` proof (1.1x multiplier). If the Forge also detected git activity or a running process during the session, the proof may be upgraded to `multi-proof` (1.5x).
