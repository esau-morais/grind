```bash
grindxp web [subcommand]
```

The web app is a browser-based view of your vault — dashboard, AI chat, quests, skills, and analytics. It reads from the same vault as the CLI and TUI, so all data stays in sync automatically.

## Subcommands

### `web start`

```bash
grindxp web start
```

Starts the web app as a background daemon on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` and opens it in your default browser. If the app is already running, it reuses the existing process and opens the browser.

### `web stop`

```bash
grindxp web stop
```

Stops the running background daemon (SIGTERM → SIGKILL if needed).

### `web status`

```bash
grindxp web status
```

Shows the PID, start time, URL, and whether the app is currently reachable.

### `web serve`

```bash
grindxp web serve [--no-open]
```

Runs the web app in the **foreground**. Pass `--no-open` to suppress the browser launch — the right flag for headless servers and process managers:

```bash
grindxp web serve --no-open
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. This is the command to use inside a systemd unit or PM2 for production deployments.

## Configuration

The web app reads vault path and encryption key from `~/.grind/config.json`. No additional configuration is needed for basic use.

| Variable | Default | Description                 |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------- |
| `PORT`   | `3000`  | Port the web app listens on |

<Warning>
  The web app binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only) and has **no built-in authentication**. Do not
  expose it on a public interface without an auth gate. Use an SSH tunnel, Tailscale, or a reverse
  proxy with Cloudflare Access / HTTP basic auth for remote access.
</Warning>
