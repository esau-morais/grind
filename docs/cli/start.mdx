```bash
grindxp start
```

Presents a list of `available` or `active` quests. Selecting one starts a timer session. The timer state is written to `~/.grind/timer.json`.

Only one timer can run at a time. Starting a new timer while one is running will prompt you to stop the existing one first.

## Proof Bonus

| Elapsed                     | Proof Type    | Multiplier |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Any duration                | `duration`    | 1.1x       |
| Combined with other signals | `multi-proof` | 1.5x       |
