The gateway is an HTTP server that receives incoming webhooks and normalizes them into `signals` for the Forge to process.

## Subcommands

### `gateway start`

```bash
grindxp gateway start
```

Starts the gateway and enables autostart using the OS service manager when available (`launchd`, `systemd --user`, or Task Scheduler). Runtime state is tracked in `~/.grind/gateway-state.json`.

### `gateway enable`

```bash
grindxp gateway enable
```

Alias for `gateway start`.

### `gateway stop`

```bash
grindxp gateway stop
```

Stops the running gateway process.

### `gateway disable`

```bash
grindxp gateway disable
```

Disables gateway autostart and stops the gateway.

### `gateway restart`

```bash
grindxp gateway restart
```

Stops and restarts the gateway.

### `gateway status`

```bash
grindxp gateway status
```

Shows runtime status, autostart status, health, and endpoint.

### `gateway serve`

```bash
grindxp gateway serve
```

Runs the gateway in the foreground (useful for debugging webhook delivery).
