```bash
grindxp complete
```

Presents a list of `available` and `active` quests. Selecting one marks it `completed` and awards XP using a `self-report` proof (1.0x multiplier).

For higher XP:

- Use [`start`](/cli/start) + [`stop`](/cli/stop) to get a `duration` proof (1.1x)
- Let the Forge auto-complete via signals for `multi-proof` (1.5x)

## What Happens on Completion

1. Quest status → `completed`
2. Streak incremented (for `daily` / `weekly` quests)
3. XP calculated: `base_xp × difficulty × streak_bonus × proof_bonus`
4. XP awarded to character
5. XP distributed to all tagged skills
6. Completion logged to `quest_logs`
