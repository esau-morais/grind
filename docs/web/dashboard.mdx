The dashboard is the default screen at `/app`. It pulls live data from your vault and updates as you complete quests.

## What you see

**Stats row** (four cards at the top):

- Total XP earned
- XP earned today
- Best active streak (in days)
- Total quests completed

**Active Quests**: Up to five quests you've started. Each shows type, difficulty, objective progress, and streak count.

**Skills**: Your top six skills by XP, each with a level badge and progress bar toward the next level.

**Recent Activity**: The last ten quest completions with XP earned, proof type, and relative time.

## When your vault isn't set up

If Grind hasn't been initialized yet, the dashboard shows a prompt to run `grind init`. Everything else waits until the vault exists.
