The chat screen at `/app/chat` is a full AI companion interface built into the web app.

## Interface

**Conversation sidebar**: Browse and switch between past conversations. Each session is stored in your vault and accessible at any time.

**Message area**: Streaming responses appear token by token. When the companion uses a tool (looking up your quests, checking your XP, running a command), the tool call appears inline as a collapsible card showing what was sent and what came back.

**Input**: Type your message and press `Cmd+Enter` (or `Ctrl+Enter`) to send. Auto-grows as you type.

## Starting a conversation

Click any conversation in the sidebar to load it, or start a new one. An empty state shows suggested prompts to get you going:

- What should I work on today?
- How's my consistency looking this week?
- Create a daily quest for evening reading.
- What's my highest-level skill?

## Tool visibility

When the companion takes an action (checking your vault, creating a quest, running a search), you'll see exactly what it did and what the result was. Nothing happens invisibly.

## Sessions

Conversations are saved automatically to your vault. Nothing is sent to any external service beyond the AI provider you've configured.

<Note>
  The companion chat uses the same AI provider and trust level you've set up with `grindxp setup`.
  See [Your AI Companion](/companion/overview) for configuration.
