<Note>
  This screen is in active development. Use `grindxp forge` to manage rules from the terminal in the
  meantime.
</Note>

The forge screen at `/app/forge` will let you view active rules, see recent trigger history, toggle rules on and off, and create new automations, all without touching the CLI.

See [Forge](/cli/forge) for the full automation reference.
