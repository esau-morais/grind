  This screen is in active development. Use `grindxp quest list` or the terminal app (`grindxp`,
  then press `q`) to browse quests in the meantime.
</Note>

The quests screen at `/app/quests` will let you browse all your quests, filter by type and status, create new ones, and view completion history, all without leaving the browser.
